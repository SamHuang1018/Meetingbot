# Meeting Bot
This project aims to integrate the GPT API with various major communication platforms. It utilizes Fast-Whisper for speech-to-text conversion and PyAnnote for dialogue recognition, ensuring accurate transcription and recording of meeting content.
The converted text data is stored in Firebase, facilitating easy data management and access. The bot can generate meeting summaries, transcripts, and relevant suggestions, and it can also create mind maps and PPTs, enhancing meeting efficiency and visualization.
